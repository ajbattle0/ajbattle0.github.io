Next I set out these houses in a grid that added up to 215 making room for the logo and text to fit in snuggly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As each house was almost a square I found that it read well as a pixel. Using this to create some simple pixel art I made a radiating heart pattern using the brand colours.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once this was created I grouped each heart cluster as its own object and exported it in sections.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Staff and volunteers section:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/ajbattle.files.wordpress.com\/2021\/03\/people2.png?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1621\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For this part I wanted to represent the number 1650 which is a huge number. The issue is that 1650 of something in a grid would have to be very simplistic or it would be hard to see when scaled to a size where it fits. Therefore I used an simplified icon of a person.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My idea was to have a wave flood and fill the icons of people. To do this I made this saw shape. This would move over the image going from upwards and to the left. This would start by obscuring the grid of people but as it moves up and across more of the grid would be revealed which would look like waves passing by.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/ajbattle.files.wordpress.com\/2021\/03\/wave-for-evidence.png?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1629\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Quotes section:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/ajbattle.files.wordpress.com\/2021\/03\/t1v2.png?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1622\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I made a simple syringe using the different colours of the brand for each element of it. I then added 5 rectangles in the background to add some more complexity to the image. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the design considerations was that as the bars were the same colours as the syringe this would mean that parts of the syringe would be obscured by it which would have the effect of helping to abstract the image.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">#7 Converting into videos.<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I began by making each section as its own video. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>  Staff and volunteers video<\/strong>:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/ajbattle.files.wordpress.com\/2021\/03\/image.png?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1626\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The first video I made was the staff and volunteers one. In after effects we have 4 boxes. In the top left is all the files that we upload. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here I uploaded all the separate pieces from the graphic. I then brought those elements down into bottom left box which adds them to the timeline on bottom right.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I then reorganised these elements so that they were in the correct order. The background at the bottom of the stack so that its underneath all of the other graphics, the grid of people, the wave over the top.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the bottom right box we can see that we have a bar that corresponds to each of the objects that have been added to the composition. Where the bar starts and ends in the composition shows when it starts and ends within the video.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/ajbattle.files.wordpress.com\/2021\/03\/image-1.png?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1631\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Upon further expanding the object in the bottom left box we can see that there are transform actions applied to the object. A dot under the bar represents where these changes happens and start within the video. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So at <strong>0.06<\/strong> we can see that the opacity and the position of <strong>te2v2.png<\/strong> object changes from one state to another at <strong>0.22<\/strong> in this case it started with 0 opacity slightly above where it wanted to be within the composition and as it transforms it becomes opaque and settles into the position it wants to be in.  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For this video the text objects drop and fade into video one after the other while the wave moves across the grid of people and it slowly fills up.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p> <strong> Organisation video<\/strong>: <\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/ajbattle.files.wordpress.com\/2021\/03\/image-2.png?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1633\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For this video I had saved each ring of houses as its own layer. After loading them into the timeline they were put in order and then spaced equally apart on the bar so that they came in rhythmically.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here there were things I did to make this process smooth and easy:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>All the layers had anchor points in the corners so they didn&#8217;t need moving about once they were uploaded they fitted correctly within the composition.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>The layers were named so it was obvious what order they were supposed to be in. <\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>I read the timeline carefully to make sure they were all spaced evenly.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>For each of the heart layers I also added a transform effect.
