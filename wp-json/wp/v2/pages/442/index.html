Instead objects are made to conform to a transformed grid. One of the things I was interested in was how other designers were able to make this style feel modern exciting. It seemed that a good starting point was to use a simple palette.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-2 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"280\" data-id=\"445\" src=\"http:\/\/ajbattle.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/6-3.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-445\" srcset=\"http:\/\/ajbattle.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/6-3.webp 500w, http:\/\/ajbattle.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/6-3-300x168.webp 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"619\" data-id=\"447\" src=\"http:\/\/ajbattle.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/starting-point.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-447\" srcset=\"http:\/\/ajbattle.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/starting-point.webp 1000w, http:\/\/ajbattle.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/starting-point-300x186.webp 300w, http:\/\/ajbattle.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/starting-point-768x475.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/figure>\n<\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">#3 Drafting a design<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"http:\/\/ajbattle.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/image-10.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-450\" srcset=\"http:\/\/ajbattle.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/image-10.webp 1024w, http:\/\/ajbattle.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/image-10-300x169.webp 300w, http:\/\/ajbattle.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/image-10-768x432.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The tool I decided to use for this was affinity designer. They have very powerful isometric design creation tools.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After creating my isometric grid and setting it so that objects would snap to it I then was able to create a plane set.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The plane set allows you to transform shapes to make them conform to the isometric design. so you can take a shape and so that it follows the geometry of isometric design.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"724\" height=\"1023\" src=\"http:\/\/ajbattle.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/7-3.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-451\" srcset=\"http:\/\/ajbattle.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/7-3.webp 724w, http:\/\/ajbattle.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/7-3-212x300.webp 212w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 724px) 100vw, 724px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The first thing I did was layout the road as this would be design element that would infer the rest of the design. At each turn in the road I would have a different milestone for changes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At bottom I put a T junction to highlight the last point.  <em> All restrictions COULD be lifted <\/em> this was to show that there was a turning point here where there were two possibilities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next I set about making the different locations that represented the different points. There was a football pitch and a tennis court to represent outdoor sport. A Ferris wheel, gym and hair dressers and others.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These were then incorporated into the design which went to the client.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"724\" height=\"1023\" src=\"http:\/\/ajbattle.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/8-2.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-452\" srcset=\"http:\/\/ajbattle.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/8-2.webp 724w, http:\/\/ajbattle.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/8-2-212x300.webp 212w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 724px) 100vw, 724px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">#5 Feedback<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When speaking to the client they gave me a list of things that they wanted me to add to poster these included:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>The YCA logo.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>A way for the shops logos to stand out more.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Brighter colours.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>I added the logo and then set about recolouring the graphics to make them brighter. I  followed a simple formula. A colour for the top of the building, a colour for the right flank and one for the left flank. This stopped the design from becoming too complicated and unified the design elements together.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the shop logos I used the newly added contour tool to affinity designer to create a white border around the shops logo to make them bright and stand out.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All colours I used were taken from the YCA&#8217;s bright logo that I had created.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also added the text at this stage. Adding waypoints inspired by google maps.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">#6 Final version<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"724\" height=\"1023\" src=\"http:\/\/ajbattle.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/final-1.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-453\" srcset=\"http:\/\/ajbattle.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/final-1.webp 724w, http:\/\/ajbattle.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/final-1-212x300.webp 212w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 724px) 100vw, 724px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With this completed I sent a copy over to the client who used it for their business purposes.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The youth group that I have designed for previously wanted a poster making that highlighted the different times that the Covid restrictions would be lifted. #1 Reading the brief This project began with this copy sent to me by the client.
