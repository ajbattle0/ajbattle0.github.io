These are always very personal pieces so it&#8217;s important to expect to do a lot of iterations, even the most simple design in this case a fern and some wildflowers will require good and continuous communication with a client.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I began this process by calling them and undertaking a short briefing to understanding their ideas fully. The aim was to create a tattoo for her wrist of a fern with a number of flowers on top.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/ajbattle.files.wordpress.com\/2023\/01\/fern-designa1.png?w=669\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3826\" style=\"width:487px;height:745px\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I started by drawing out a rough version of the tattoo. At this point I wasn&#8217;t too precious with it. The idea for the design had not formed fully in my head at this point, the arrangement of flowers was not something I had a immediate conceptual understanding off so I felt it was best to get something done so I could move onto the feedback.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After speaking to the client she came back with feedback that I was able to use to more forward; more small flowers, space between the flowers, a less cluttered fern and some more leaves.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/ajbattle.files.wordpress.com\/2023\/01\/elements.png?w=1000\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3830\" style=\"width:586px;height:483px\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Tattoo elements.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Using this feedback I created the elements for the tattoo now I knew what I needed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/ajbattle.files.wordpress.com\/2023\/01\/fern-tattooaaa.png?w=500\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3832\" style=\"width:292px;height:468px\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Second Iteration<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I then arranged the elements and set the drawing layer as a linear burn over the colour to represent the flowers. Once again I sent this for feedback which resulted in this series of designs:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/ajbattle.files.wordpress.com\/2023\/01\/adadfa.png?w=1000\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3834\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Third Iteration<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Of this selection she went with the third one.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/ajbattle.files.wordpress.com\/2023\/01\/image.png?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3836\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Shading<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>At this stage I shaded the tattoo to add depth and allow for easy colour variation. I use vibrant colours to represent the different areas of shade so I can easily from a glance see what areas need working on. On top of this I then added a gradient map set to the colour values replacing them with more appealing colours.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/ajbattle.files.wordpress.com\/2023\/01\/gshsh.png?w=500\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3838\" style=\"width:297px;height:476px\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">4th iteration<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The client sent her final feedback for a recoloring of a few flowers so she could see what she prefered. After going through a few versions eventually she settled on this design.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/ajbattle.files.wordpress.com\/2023\/01\/hhh.png?w=639\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3840\" style=\"width:329px;height:527px\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">5th iteration<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A fun project altogether, ultimately I will be excited to see how the tattoo looks once tattooed. I was lucky in this project to have client that was able to communicate frequently and who already had an understanding of my work which lead to a positive outcome.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A client recently asked for a tattoo design.
