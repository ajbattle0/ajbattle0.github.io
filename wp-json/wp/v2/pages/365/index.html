After coming together, deciding on a direction and researching we then delegated out tasks and began working.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For my part I sketched an idea as to what I wanted to create for the game. In this case a jumper game where you dodge around the prizes on the conveyor belt and try to stay on the belt as long as possible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"step-1-research\">Step #1 Research<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For this project the idea was to combine the generation game with animals. In this case we decided to have the playable characters as animals. This mean&#8217;t I would have to look at how to create characters that look like animals and also look at attire that would fit them for the setting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the generation game was set in the 70s then 70s attire and designs would make sense for the best clothing scheme.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/ajbattle.files.wordpress.com\/2022\/02\/image.png?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3095\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>One of my team was nice enough to set up a Pinterest page for the project and so we started pulling in influences.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I decided upon 4 subcultures\/archetypes that interested me the most in creating characters around:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Goth culture; with the big hats, black flowing dresses and pale makeup a goth character would contrast nicely with the bright colours and designs within the rest of the game.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Hippy culture; A 70s classic. Brown natural tones mixed in with floral prints and hand sown jackets.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Preppy culture; One of big cultural events of the 70s was the explosion of interest in American highschool culture with films like Grease. The American jersey is a look that I was to try recreate.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Sportswear culture; The sportswear clothing craze started in the 70s with the explosion in interest in exercise as a healthy pursuit. The iconic jumpsuit and full matching outfits grew out of this time.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>As for the animal nature of the contestants I looked at the work of a few artists to get inspiration on how to achieve this:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/ajbattle.files.wordpress.com\/2022\/02\/screenshot1.0.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3112\" style=\"width:690px;height:459px\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">The clean vector shapes from <em>Night in the Woods<\/em><br><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/ajbattle.files.wordpress.com\/2022\/02\/bunnymilitaryoperationscopy.jpg?w=1000\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3114\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">The character designs of Kyle Ferrin<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/multiversitystatic.s3.amazonaws.com\/uploads\/2021\/08\/OZ-chapter8.jpg?fit=600%2C913\" alt=\"Interview with a Webcomic: Evan Dahm on 2nd World Fantasies, \u201cVattu\u201d and  \u201cMoby Dick\u201d \u2013 Multiversity Comics\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">The art of Evan Dahm<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"creating-assets-2\">Creating assets #2<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With these ideas in mind I then did some sketching before developing those sketches into vector drawings:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Concept art:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/ajbattle.files.wordpress.com\/2022\/05\/character-design1.png?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3371\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I began by creating some initial designs for the rabbit.
