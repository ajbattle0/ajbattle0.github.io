This is a perfect opportunity to showcase how you believe people of these diversity groups would like to be portrayed, with a refreshing new and authentic take.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter if you are brand new to video games industry (perhaps you\u2019re a fan keen to learn some new skills!) or if you\u2019re already in the industry and just looking to make something awesome. Come join us in this fun experiment, meet new friends, learn some new skills and have a ball!\n\n\nFAQ \/Rules\nWho can participate in the 10:10 WIGJam?\n\nYou and your team will need itch.io accounts to be able to join the jam and submit your entry\nPlease register via https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/1010-wigjam-tickets-365663779207 - this will give you access to our Discord and check eligibility\nAt least one person in your group should identify as a woman, or as part of the LGBTIQA+ community\nDo you have a max group size?\n\n1-4 is recommended, as it will be easier to coordinate and communicate\nSolo entries are perfectly fine\nIf you are looking for a group, there will be a section in our Discord to coordinate\nWhich game engine can we use?\n\nAll Game Engines are fine, as long we have the application and can play it on a Windows machine\nWill there be any support from 10:10 Devs throughout the Game Jam weekend?\n\nDevs will be standing by to offer advice and mentorship, throughout the weekend via our Discord (Link to be found in your Eventbrite ticket)\n\nCan I use pre-existing assets (my own, or others) in the Jam?\n\nOnly if you have the rights to the assets, or its under a fair-use policy, please properly credit assets you have taken from elsewhere.\nAudio must be royalty\/copyright free and properly credited.\nWhat are the judging criteria?\n\n4 Categories\nUse of theme \u2013 How well did you interpret the theme?\nGameplay \u2013 Is it fun?\nVisual \u2013 How is the artstyle?

We wrote down any ideas we had for the game whilst actively discussing ideas over voice chat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The advantages of this process improves the creative process in a few ways:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Ideas are written down and so aren&#8217;t forgotten.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Provides a visual representation of what everyone is thinking during the discussion so makes it easier to understand other peoples perspectives.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Saves time getting ideas out as people don&#8217;t need to wait for a chance to speak to talk about their ideas.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Allows people to collaborate with other peoples ideas.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Keeps ideas small and understandable by sticking to the post it note size.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Allows less confident speakers to collaborate.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/ajbattle.files.wordpress.com\/2022\/08\/image-1.png?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3539\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Using this method we were able to come to a quick consensus as to what we wanted for the game:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>A older lesbian main character on a space ship who has to grow a plant.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Looking after a plant through three stages of growth.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>A futuristic feel to the spaceship and a alien feel to the plant.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>The plant requiring three types of nourishment, water, meat and music (because its alien)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>A cinematic at the start and the end of the game.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Secondly once we had the games idea we broke this down into the different tasks that would be required. We wrote these out on trello. Which would allow the team to keep a record of everything that was being worked on and by who. This also made it easier to visually see everything that needed to be done.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/ajbattle.files.wordpress.com\/2022\/08\/image-2.png?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3540\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally we used discord for chatting and sharing progress. I often used it for the one to ones I had with the team to make sure that everyone was doing well and helping connect the art of the game with the programming required.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We began by assigning roles:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Myself: Create the art for the plant and animate it.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Kit Westall (twitter.com\/kibblemeat); create the art for the game and the cinematics.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Kerrie Holland (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/hikerrie\/\">https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/hikerrie\/<\/a>); Find audio for the game.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Team writer and coder; Code the game and writing<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately our teams writer and coder was unable to participate but luckily I also had some experience within coding so we decided that I wouldn&#8217;t animate the plant and instead would focus on coding the game.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kerrie took over writing duties aswell writing the games blog and the games text.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ui\">#3 UI<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I set up a simple UI using the same system that I used within the Death is only the beginning game.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This was done simply with this method:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Create a canvas that the menu is on with buttons to the different sub menus.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Make a script that has a list of public voids that opens scenes.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>In the on click() part of the button add the object the script is attached to and then choose the public void that changes to the required scene.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>If the button is opening a sub menu then instead the canvas that the menu is attached to is enabled and the menu that is being left is disabled.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/ajbattle.files.wordpress.com\/2022\/08\/image-3.png?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3541\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I created a few assets for the menu. The buttons and the title:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-slideshow aligncenter\" data-effect=\"slide\"><div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_container swiper-container\"><ul class=\"wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_swiper-wrapper swiper-wrapper\"><li class=\"wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide\"><figure><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_image wp-image-3543\" data-id=\"3543\" src=\"https:\/\/ajbattle.files.wordpress.com\/2022\/08\/button.png?w=667\"\/><\/figure><\/li><li class=\"wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide\"><figure><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_image wp-image-3544\" data-id=\"3544\" src=\"https:\/\/ajbattle.files.wordpress.com\/2022\/08\/titlea.png?w=1024\"\/><\/figure><\/li><\/ul><a class=\"wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-prev swiper-button-prev swiper-button-white\" role=\"button\"><\/a><a class=\"wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-next swiper-button-next swiper-button-white\" role=\"button\"><\/a><a aria-label=\"Pause Slideshow\" class=\"wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-pause\" role=\"button\"><\/a><div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_pagination swiper-pagination swiper-pagination-white\"><\/div><\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>For the buttons I wanted to reflect the spaceship background that Kit had created and create something that still was legible. As for the Title I went with two fonts that had a space feel to them adding planet rings to the O and a green gradient to botany to connect it to botany.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With video games you are able to be a lot more extravagant with logo design but I went with a more clean design to fit with the space theme and to make it easier for the team to share the project with clients who might not know as much about video games.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"dialogue\">#4 Coding<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately our teams coder was unable to work on this project. Therefore I took over the position of programmer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We decided to go with a Rhythm game gameplay as that was what I felt comfortable coding. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/ajbattle.files.wordpress.com\/2022\/08\/image-4.png?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3549\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Concept art by Kit<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Our concept artist Kit quickly created an idea for how this would work that I used as a reference.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this a token spawns in line with its corresponding colour. If the player hits the button corresponding to the colour they get a point. If they miss it they lose a penalty. If they lose too many penalties they lose and the level reset. Get enough and the game moves onto the next level.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>No.1 making the tokens spawn<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first part of the code I created was a script to make the tokens this spawn.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The way this worked was by making a copy of a token using the code:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">public void SpawnRedToken()\n{\n        Instantiate(RedTokenReference, RedTokenSpawnTarget.transform.position, Quaternion.identity);\n\n }\n public void SpawnBlueToken()\n{\n        Instantiate(BlueTokenReference, BlueTokenSpawnTarget.transform.position, Quaternion.identity);\n\n    }\n\n    public void SpawnGreenToken()\n{\n        Instantiate(GreenTokenReference, GreenTokenSpawnTarget.transform.position, Quaternion.identity);\n\n    }<\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are 3 public voids that the game can call. Instantiate makes a clone of the gameobject in this case RedTokenReference, BlueTokenReference and GreenTokenReference. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next part is where the target should spawn. In this case at the top of the screen in the corresponding line for its colour.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">TokenInterval = TokenInterval + 1;\n            if (TokenInterval &gt;= TokenIntervalAmount)\n            {\n                TokenInterval = 0;\n                WhichTokenRandomNumber = Random.Range(1, LevelDifficulty);\n                if (WhichTokenRandomNumber == 1)\n                {\n                    Invoke(\"SpawnRedToken\", 1.0f);\n                    \/\/Debug.Log(\"Red\");\n                }\n                if (WhichTokenRandomNumber == 2)\n                {\n                    Invoke(\"SpawnBlueToken\", 1.0f);\n                    \/\/Debug.Log(\"Blue\");\n                }\n                if (WhichTokenRandomNumber == 3)\n                {\n                    Invoke(\"SpawnGreenToken\", 1.0f);\n                    \/\/Debug.Log(\"Green\");\n                }\n                if (WhichTokenRandomNumber == 4)\n                {\n                    Invoke(\"SpawnRedToken\", 1.0f);\n                    Invoke(\"SpawnBlueToken\", 1.0f);\n                    \/\/Debug.Log(\"Red + Blue\");\n                }\n                if (WhichTokenRandomNumber == 5)\n                {\n                    Invoke(\"SpawnRedToken\", 1.0f);\n                    Invoke(\"SpawnGreenToken\", 1.0f);\n                    \/\/Debug.Log(\"Red + Green\");\n                }\n                if (WhichTokenRandomNumber == 6)\n                {\n                    Invoke(\"SpawnBlueToken\", 1.0f);\n                    Invoke(\"SpawnGreenToken\", 1.0f);\n                    \/\/Debug.Log(\"Blue + Green\");\n                }\n                if (WhichTokenRandomNumber == 7)\n                {\n                    Invoke(\"SpawnRedToken\", 1.0f);\n                    Invoke(\"SpawnGreenToken\", 1.0f);\n                    Invoke(\"SpawnBlueToken\", 1.0f);\n                    \/\/Debug.Log(\"Red Blue and Green\");\n                }<\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Further down inside of void up. This part of the code creates the token. The way it works is there is a float called TokenInterval that with every update has +1 added to it. Then this reached whatever TokenIntervalAmount is set to. The TokenInterval is reset and the code inside in the if statement is played.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>WhichTokenRandomNumber is set to a number in between 1 and whatever LevelDifficulty is set to. If set to 4 the random number can be a number that corresponds to creating either a red, blue or green token. At 6 it can also spawn a red and a blue or a green and a red. At 8 it can also spawn a blue and a green or all three at once. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This then invokes the public void from earlier corresponding to the tokens required to make.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having TokenIntervalAmount and LevelDifficulty be floats that can be altered it makes it easy to alter how fast the tokens come down and how complex the input is.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>No.2 Making the Tokens move.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To make each token move I added this code to them that would make them move downwards based on time x whatever speed I set them to.
