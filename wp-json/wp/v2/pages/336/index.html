At the start I took up the role of project manager and began working with the client and the team to create the project.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The project was to create a mobile game set inside of a garden with humanoid animals living in their own little zone which was then related to the music period that they represented.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This was a very similar direction to that which we took with the previous <a href=\"https:\/\/ajbattle.wordpress.com\/2022\/02\/03\/project-25-2-week-game-assets-and-animations\/\">project <\/a>however now there were a few extra key features:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>There was no coder on the team we would we coding the game ourselves.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>The game was set in a garden rather then a game studio and so would need a world creating aswell including environments that the characters would live in.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>The game would have require a story.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>The game was for phone.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>The game was in 3D and would have an AR component.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Step #1 Research<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>After meeting with the client and discussing with the team we were able to find out what people were interested in working on and then assign roles accordingly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the starting tasks was to research about the different aspects of the game. I wrote a number of reports regarding this information. Learning about the different systems.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The brief required that each character would have their own zone within a &#8220;garden&#8221; for this I looked for inspiration.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>For this I looked at:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Buildings that represent a time period well.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Buildings that exist well within nature with an empathises on camping.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Interesting environments for the buildings to exist in.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped

As inspiration for this zone I looked back on the places I had been in the past that I felt were good examples of beauty and so was heavily inspired by Keswick.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/ajbattle.files.wordpress.com\/2022\/04\/keswick-from-latrigg.jpg?w=800\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3273\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Keswick<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/ajbattle.files.wordpress.com\/2022\/04\/background-evidence.png?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3275\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Background drawing.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I also worked with the teams concept artist and redrew their zones as small icons.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/ajbattle.files.wordpress.com\/2022\/04\/icons-evidence.png?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3276\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Icons drawing.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Colouring<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To colour this menu I took the project into affinity designer and got to work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li> To make use of the drawing I set the drawing to linear burn and put it on the top layer.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>I added a shadow layer with the median colour for project (Note I didn&#8217;t really shade this project but this step would make it easier to do so in another project.) This was sent to the back of the layers.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>I began separating out the different areas of the drawing such as tree as fields. I separated out the sky and water then drew colours into them whereas the layers with none reflective were set to colour.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/ajbattle.files.wordpress.com\/2022\/04\/image-3.png?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3280\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>To make the drawing alot more interesting I used gradients for most of the colour layers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/ajbattle.files.wordpress.com\/2022\/04\/image-2.png?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3278\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Step #5 Animating the assets<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/ajbattle.files.wordpress.com\/2022\/04\/image.png?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3207\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I took these assets into unity and created a simple animation for them. This was achieved by having each layer move a different distance based on its position in the scene. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The layers at the back would move the least whilst those in the front move further. This creates the illusion of depth know as parallax. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On top of this is I created a canvas in unity and added buttons and other menu elements. I then wrote code to have each of these elements lead to different locations and animated the buttons so that they felt more intuitive. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Step #6 Integration into the game<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For each level of the game I created a pause menu and a score menu and used code to integrate these into the game the pause menu would allow you to return to the start of the game and the score menus counted the games points.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Step #7 Working with the team<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At the start of this project we had some sessions to learn how to work together well in a team. From this I took a fair few points and made an effort to communicate well and postively.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Step #8 Final outcome<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Once all of the different parts of the game were completed I put them together.

I hope you are recovering well. \n\nWe missed you in the presentation, but I can say that your team did a fantastic job in the final presentation, \u2b1b\u2b1b led the presentation amazingly and your peers managed to say your part. \u2b1b\u2b1b was impressed with the final work, she said that you all satisfied her expectations.  \n\nWell done on the hard work you put together in this project and all the designs you created throughout this creative journey. \n\nDuring this project, you and your team faced challenges, and as team you always managed to show resourcefulness, adaptability and commitment. You demonstrated diverse skills in all your creative stages, and your final pieces are a culmination of that.\n\nThe energy, creativity, professionalism and effort you put into this did a successful project and it has been a joy to see your creative process. \ud83d\ude42 Big congrats on that! \n\nNext week I will share your final submission feedback with your team.
